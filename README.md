# Aspect Matlab Compiler

This is a Wu-Wei wrapper done around the [Aspect Matlab Compiler](https://github.com/Sable/AspectMatlab). AspectMatlab 
does not work with recent versions of MATLAB, please use an older version for the execution environment.

It has been successfully tested with the 2013a and 2014b versions of matlab. It does not work with the 2015b and 2015a versions. 

If you are using the McGill School of Computer Science computers, you may test this compiler with the latest versions of the preconfigured environments tagged with 'socs' in the releases of the [Ostrich MATLAB environment](https://github.com/Sable/ostrich-matlab-environment/releases).
